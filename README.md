#Publishing
This blog is generated with the Jekyll engine. Simple and easy formatting that sticks to the basics. All static HTML too, so worrying about scalability is non-existent.

All other directories and files are MIT Licensed. I am very happy for others to use my design as a basis for their own site but PLEASE ensure you delete all my content (i.e., pages, blog posts, etc) before uploading your version to the web.

Be especially careful with some of the dynamic content and javascript I use on my pages, particularly:
- **Disqus comments on blog posts**
