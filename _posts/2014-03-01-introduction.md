This is the new home of my website. I'm trying something new and using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to build this site and for hosting I'm using [Github Pages](http://http://pages.github.com/). Working with Jekyll has been a ton of fun and learning to build websites in a different manner than I have been used to was a great side project. If you're not familiar with Jekyll, I highly recommend checking it out but here is a brief quote on what it does.

<blockquote>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. </blockquote>

To help with the creation of this site I'm using some CSS from [Fluid 960](http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs/) to help with formatting. All of the code used in creating this website can be found and forked from my [githup account](https://github.com/phillipreagan). Feel free to learn and take what you want from the code but please, only use my design and content as inspiration (or a roadmap for what not to do ;) ).

I'm starting brand new with this site and not importing any posts from my past blogs into here. Only the best and freshest content for you guys! The design is still a work in progress but right now I'm digging the clean, simple look that I've started here. Articles pertaining to what I'm working on and playing with are on their way. Stay tuned!
