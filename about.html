               	<p>With sore thumbs and a desire to breathe life into my own ideas, I started my journey to turn my love of video games into a career very early on. Starting with a TRS-80 and learning by copying code snippets out of magazines, I gradually worked my way up to better hardware and code of my own. After spending some time developing games in more traditional programming languages, such as C++, I found new love in Adobe Flash. The ability to rapidly bring my ideas to fruition and have them playable by everyone across the web made Flash/Actionscript my goto tool. For the past 11 years, I have had a great career creating games spanning all genres and working at companies such as Acclaim, Kabam and Disney.</p>

                <p>My focus has now shifted over to mobile/desktop development primarily in Unity. I'm also wiping the cobwebs off of my old C++ skills to get back to my roots. Keep an eye on this site and my github page to see my upcoming game releases, side projects and experiments.</p>
