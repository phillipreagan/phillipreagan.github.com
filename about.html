               	<p>With sore thumbs and a desire to breathe life into my own ideas, I started my journey to turn my love of video games into a career very early on. Starting with a TRS-80 and learning by copying code snippets out of magazines, I gradually worked my way up to better hardware and code of my own. After spending some time developing games in more traditional programming languages, such as C++, I found new love in Adobe Flash. The ability to rapidly bring my ideas to fruition and have them playable by everyone across the web made Flash my goto tool. My skill with Flash, good coding practices and eye for design has led to an exciting career developing games, for the past 10 years, at companies such as Acclaim and Playdom.</p>

                <p>Flash is still a big part of my life though my focus has now shifted to its' new 3D capabilities and Adobe Mobile Air. This year I plan on bringing, at least, three games to IOS, Android, and your local neighborhood browser. In addition to Flash I'm also cultivating my second passion ... web design and development. Articles showing off my mad javascript, HTML5 and server side code are inbound to your jugular. You have been warned.</p>

                <p>If it is not evident yet, let me make it clear that I love to build and create! The technology and frameworks that I use are simply tools and I'm constantly on the lookout for better ones. Learning keeps my mind sharp, the creative juices flowing and opens me up to new possibilities. Expect to see articles and experiments on the latest thing that I'm playing with here regularly. I'm excited to see what the future brings and I hope my musing and tinkerings on this site will help others.</p>
